What is docker?
 
Before going to in detail I would like to share how the logo came..
Its named after Molly dick a female sperm whale whick was earlier named as moby dick.
And also Docker held a fundraiser in which Roderic Mast, president of The Oceanic Society – a nonprofit founded in the 1960s to protect ocean life – spoke about ocean conservation and how container ships in the ocean can harm whales.

All this is happening even though Docker and application containers have nothing to do with container ships or actual whales (other than the company’s logo is a whale). Application containers are a way to virtualize the operating system to more efficiently pack applications on to a server and more easily migrate code from various host environments.

In simpler words Docker is an open-source tool that automates the deployment of an application inside a software container. 

A simple anlogy that can give to a docker is consider a container before the concept of container there were a issue like how to pack different items like edible and not edible since the concept of contaoiner came it reduced the use of space as well as the ease of packing of two different items

The most common doubt usually comes is that how Virtual environment is different from docker. So VM is act as a guest os on the system os and it may use GB of same where docker can act on the system os itself. In other words docker share the kernel.
And another significant difference  is that VM need more time to boot.

There is no need of third party app when we are using docker and we can run the container as such it also gives a provition that to run multiple version of same application simultaneously

Docker gives a unifide image format which helps to distribute across different machines(say hosts). If docker is there no need to remember where the dependencies are and related stuffs. Dockers native platform is linux and still it can be run on mac-os as well as windows
